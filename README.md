# ModHelper
Load mods and change settings on the fly for listen (and maybe dedi) servers.

Extremely simplistic program that passes commands to the console window of IW4 (MW2).

Based off of the code from my IW4Connecter, this was written nearly 6 years ago. I dug it up, brushed it off, and got it working again.


How to use:

	1. Copy ModHelper.exe into your MW2 folder
	2. Place all of your mods in the "mods" folder
	3. Run ModHelper.exe 
	4. Choose a mod, map, gametype, and any other settings
	5. Click "Execute" at the bottom (make sure Start MW2 is checked if the game isn't running)


The code is old and messy. Feel free to contribute or suggest commands or options you'd like to see added :smile:
